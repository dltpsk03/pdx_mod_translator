### API Settings
![API Settings](asset/image%202%20-%20API%20setting.png)

- Currently, you can choose from 5 APIs
- 2.5 Flash: Default
- 2.0 Flash: An option to avoid censorship
- 1.5 Series: When cost is a concern
- 2.5 Pro: For those who want high quality (very expensive and has strict limits!!)

### Folder Selection

### Language Settings
![Language Settings](asset/image%204%20-%20Language%20Setting.png)

- Currently supports English, Korean, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, and Turkish

### Translation Settings
![Translation Settings](asset/image%205%20-%20Translation%20Setting.png)

- **Batch Size**: How many lines to translate at once.
- **Concurrent Files**: How many files to translate simultaneously.
- **Max Output Tokens**: Controls the maximum number of tokens (set to 65536 for 2.5, 8192 for others).
- **Delay Between Batches**: Sets the time delay between API responses.
- **File Split Threshold**: A feature to split long files for translation (e.g., a 30,000-line file set to 1000 will be split into 30 parts).
- **Temperature**: How creative you want the responses to be (closer to 0 is more deterministic, closer to 2.0 is more imaginative).
- **Max Retries**: How many times to retry a batch if an error occurs during translation.

- **Keep Original l_english identifier**: Check this if your language is not supported by the game.
- **Prioritize UI setting...**: Check this if the source language of the file you want to translate is also not supported by the game (e.g., translating Chinese -> Korean in Europa Universalis).
- **Skip Already Translated Lines**: Use this when translating a partially translated mod.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### TranslatorEngine (`translator_app/core/translator_engine.py`)
- Handles API calls and file processing.
- Implements batch translation and recovery mechanisms.

#### TranslationGUI (`translator_app/gui/main_window.py`)
- The main application window.
- Coordinates all UI panels and manages application state.

#### SettingsManager (`translator_app/core/settings_manager.py`)
- Handles settings persistence and loading.

### GUI Panel Structure

#### Settings Panels (`translator_app/gui/panels/`)

## Translation Workflow

1.  **File Discovery**: Scans for YAML files (.yml/.yaml) in the input folder.
2.  **Batch Processing**: Splits large files based on a configurable threshold.
3.  **API Translation**: Uses the Google Gemini API with custom prompts and glossaries.
4.  **Recovery System**: Checkpoint-based recovery for interrupted translations.
5.  **Quality Assurance**: Built-in YAML syntax validation and translation quality checks.
